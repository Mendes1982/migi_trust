## 🚀 Vision
MIGI Trust Hub is an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) platform that solves the "Trust Crisis" in emerging markets. By combining **Solana's high-speed blockchain** with **FairScale's reputation scoring**, we provide a tamper-proof verification layer for freelancers, logistics, and healthcare providers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Smart Contracts:** Anchor / Rust (Deployed on Solana Devnet)
- **Reputation Engine:** FairScale API (FairScore Integration)
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express (Secure Proxy for API Masking)
- **Frontend:** HTML5 / JavaScript (Integrated with Phantom Wallet)

## 🏗️ Architecture
MIGI Trust Hub operates on a tri-layer architecture:
1. **Validation Layer:** Consults FairScale to verify wallet history.
2. **Execution Layer:** A Solana Smart Contract that records reputation.
3. **Escrow Layer (Upcoming):** Secure Pix-to-USDC gateway.

## 📈 Roadmap
- **Q1 2024:** Bounty Submission & MVP Validation.
- **Q2 2024:** Account Abstraction & Pix Integration.
- **Q3 2024:** MIGI Health Vertical.
