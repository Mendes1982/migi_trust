# 🛡️ MIGI Trust Hub

**MIGI Trust Hub** is an on-chain reputation MVP built on **Solana** that turns service delivery milestones into **verifiable proof**.

- Live demo (wallet connect): http://migi-trust-hub-2026.surge.sh
- GitHub: https://github.com/Mendes1982/migi_trust
- Solana Program (Devnet): `3aNa219G1VwZq2gC8NRL9NRGXCbrhnhqivHDpmZS8TeA`

## What’s shipped today (MVP)
- ✅ Solana program deployed on Devnet (Anchor/Rust)
- ✅ Basic on-chain reputation primitives
- ✅ Public frontend with Phantom wallet connection (live demo)

## FairScale / FairScore integration (bounty scope)
This project is designed to integrate **FairScale FairScore** as a core signal:
- reputation gating (tiered access)
- risk management (limits / friction for low-score wallets)
- dynamic rewards (boosts for high-score wallets)

See: `docs/FAIRSCALE_INTEGRATION.md`
